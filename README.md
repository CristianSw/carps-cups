CUPS driver for Canon CARPS printers
====================================

This provides rastertocups filter and PPD files (specified by carps.drv file) which
allows these printers to print from Linux and possibly any other OS where CUPS is used.

carps-decode is a debug tool - it decodes CARPS data (created either by rastertocups
filter or windows drivers), producing a PBM bitmap and debug output.

Printers known to use CARPS data format:

MF5750				| should work

L180/L380S/L398S		| should work
L120				| not supported - different data format
MF3200 Series			| not supported - different data format, different header
MF8100 Series			| not supported - different data format, color


Problems with CUPS libusb backend
---------------------------------
The libusb backend used by CUPS since 1.4.x is crap. The code is full of quirks for
various printers and it's no surprise that it does not work properly with CARPS printers
(at least MF5730) too - the first document prints but nothing more is printed until the
printer is turned off and on again.

The solution is to set printer URI to the usblp device, e.g. "file:///dev/usb/lp0".
For this to work, file: device URIs must be enabled in CUPS configuration:
(/etc/cups/cups-files.conf)

    FileDevice Yes
